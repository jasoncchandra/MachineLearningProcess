## Understanding Business Context:

Gain a clear understanding of the business context in which the problem exists. This includes understanding the industry, domain, and the specific business challenges being faced.
Identify how solving the problem will provide value to the organization or stakeholders.

Clarifying Objectives:
Define the objectives of the project. What are you trying to achieve with the machine learning solution?
Are you aiming to increase revenue, improve customer satisfaction, reduce costs, enhance decision-making, or achieve some other goal?

Scope and Constraints:
Define the scope of the project. What are the boundaries of the problem you're tackling?
Consider any constraints, such as available resources (data, computational power), time limitations, and ethical considerations.

Defining the Problem Type:
Determine whether the problem is a classification, regression, clustering, or some other type of problem.
Specify whether it's a supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning problem, based on the availability of labeled data and the nature of the task.

Laying Out Success Criteria:
Establish how you'll measure the success of the machine learning solution.
Define specific metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, etc.) that will be used to evaluate the model's performance.


Example:
o	Sometimes this is statistical inference, [eg. assess how likely observation is due to noise]
o	Or causal relationship between variables.
o	Or predict outcome

-	Nature of output:
o	Continuous output variable = **regression** problem
o	Categorical variable = **classification** problem (etc, binary classification)
o	Ordered categorical variables = **ranking** problem
