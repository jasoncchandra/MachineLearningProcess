## 1. Say you are building an UNbalanced dataset for a binary classifier (have cancer, or no have cancer), how do you handle the situaiton?

Resampling:

Oversampling the Minority Class: This involves creating additional copies of instances from the minority class to balance the dataset. For example, if you have a dataset with 1000 no-cancer cases and only 100 cancer cases, you might randomly duplicate the 100 cancer cases to match the size of the majority class.
Undersampling the Majority Class: In this case, you randomly remove instances from the majority class to achieve a balance. For instance, if you have the same dataset, you might randomly select 100 samples from the no-cancer class to match the size of the minority class.
Example: In a fraud detection system, where fraudulent transactions are rare, you could oversample the fraud cases or undersample the non-fraud cases to create a balanced dataset.

Generate Synthetic Data:

Synthetic data generation techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) create new instances for the minority class by interpolating between existing instances. SMOTE algorithmically generates synthetic data points between existing minority class points, reducing the risk of overfitting.
Example: In a medical diagnosis task, if you have limited data for a rare disease, SMOTE can be used to generate synthetic patient cases with the disease.

Cost-Sensitive Learning:

Assign different misclassification costs to classes to make the model more sensitive to the minority class. By doing this, you prioritize minimizing the errors for the minority class, even if it means accepting more errors in the majority class.
Example: In a credit fraud detection system, the cost of missing a fraudulent transaction is much higher than flagging a legitimate transaction as fraudulent. You can assign a higher cost to misclassifying the minority class (fraudulent transactions).

Ensemble Methods:

Ensemble methods combine the predictions of multiple models. When dealing with imbalanced datasets, they can be used with appropriate class weights or resampling strategies to improve model performance. Algorithms like Random Forests, AdaBoost, or Gradient Boosting can be configured to handle class imbalance.
Example: In a churn prediction task for a subscription service, you can use an ensemble of decision trees with adjusted class weights to predict customer churn.

Threshold Adjustment:

Adjusting the classification threshold determines the point at which a model assigns a class label. In imbalanced datasets, you can lower the threshold to increase the sensitivity to the minority class, at the cost of potentially more false positives in the majority class.
Example: In a medical test for a life-threatening disease, you might lower the classification threshold to ensure that as many true cases as possible are detected, even if it means more false alarms.

Evaluation Metrics:

Be cautious with evaluation metrics. Accuracy may not be a good measure in unbalanced datasets. Instead, focus on metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, or the area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) to assess model performance more accurately.



## 2. What are some differences when you minimize squared error vs absolute error? Which error cases would each metric be appropriate?

MSE:
Characteristics:
Squaring the errors penalizes large errors more heavily than small errors. This makes MSE sensitive to outliers.
It gives more weight to data points with large errors, which can be a problem if you want to prioritize accuracy for all data points.
MSE is differentiable, which makes it suitable for optimization using techniques like gradient descent.

Appropriate Use Cases:
MSE is often used when you want the model to have strong incentives to minimize the impact of outliers or extreme errors.
It is commonly used in situations where the distribution of errors is assumed to be Gaussian (normal), as many statistical methods are based on this assumption.

MAE:
Characteristics:
MAE treats all errors equally, regardless of their size. It is less sensitive to outliers compared to MSE.
It provides a more robust measure of central tendency and is less affected by extreme values.
MAE is not differentiable at zero, which can make optimization more challenging in some cases.

Appropriate Use Cases:
MAE is often preferred when you want the model's performance to be less influenced by outliers or when you have reason to believe that the error distribution is not necessarily Gaussian.
It is commonly used in situations where you want a more interpretable error metric, as the absolute values of errors are easier to understand than squared values.


## 3. When performing K-means clustering, how to choose K?

- K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for data clustering and partitioning.
- It groups similar data points into clusters based on their features.
- The algorithm involves the following steps:
1) Initialize K cluster centroids randomly within the data space.
2) Assign each data point to the cluster whose centroid is closest (Assignment Step).
3) Recalculate the centroids by taking the mean of data points in each cluster (Update Step).
4) Repeat the Assignment and Update steps until convergence.
- The choice of the number of clusters (K) is crucial and can impact the quality of clustering results.
- Common methods to determine an optimal K include the Elbow method and the Silhouette method.
- K-means is sensitive to the initial centroids and is biased toward spherical clusters.
- It's widely used for data analysis, image processing, customer segmentation, and more.


Elbow Method:

The Elbow method is a graphical technique to find the optimal number of clusters (K).
It involves running K-means with different values of K and plotting the sum of squared distances (inertia) versus K.
Look for an "elbow point" in the plot, where the inertia starts to level off.
The K value at the elbow point is often considered the optimal number of clusters.


Silhouette Method:

The Silhouette method assesses the quality of clustering for different values of K.
It calculates a silhouette score for each K, measuring how similar data points are to their own cluster compared to other clusters.
Higher silhouette scores indicate better cluster separation.
Calculate the mean silhouette score for each K and choose the K with the highest score as the optimal number of clusters.

In summary, the Elbow method looks for an inflection point in the inertia plot, while the Silhouette method evaluates the quality of clustering using silhouette scores. These methods help determine the most suitable number of clusters for a given dataset and problem.


## 4. How to make models robust to outliners:

Use Robust Algorithms:

Choose algorithms that are inherently less sensitive to outliers, such as decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting. These models are naturally capable of handling data variations.

Robust Scaling and Standardization:

Apply robust scaling techniques like the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) or robust z-scores when preprocessing your data. These scaling methods are less affected by extreme values.

Robust Loss Functions:

Utilize loss functions that are less sensitive to outliers, such as the Huber loss for regression or the robust loss for classification. These loss functions provide a balance between mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE).

Winsorization:

Apply winsorization to replace extreme outlier values with values at a certain quantile (e.g., replace values above the 99th percentile with the value at the 99th percentile). This technique caps extreme values and reduces their influence.

Anomaly Detection and Separate Handling:

Use anomaly detection techniques to identify and label outliers separately from the majority of the data. Then, decide on an appropriate strategy for handling these outliers, such as removing them or transforming them based on domain knowledge.


## 5. You are running a multiple linear regression and you think several of the predictors are correlated. How will the results be affected? How do you deal with it?

1. Multicollinearity: High correlation between predictors leads to multicollinearity. This makes it difficult to determine the individual effect of each predictor on the dependent variable. It can also lead to unstable coefficient estimates.

2. Inflated Standard Errors: Multicollinearity tends to increase the standard errors of the coefficient estimates. This can result in wider confidence intervals and reduced statistical significance for the predictors.

3. Unreliable Coefficient Estimates: The coefficients of correlated predictors can become unstable and sensitive to small changes in the data, making them unreliable for making predictions or drawing conclusions.

How to deal:

1. Variable Selection: Remove one or more of the highly correlated predictors from the model. Choose the predictors that are most relevant to your research question or domain knowledge.

2. Feature Engineering: Create new features that are combinations of the correlated predictors. For example, you can calculate ratios, differences, or interaction terms between them to capture their joint effect.

3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Use PCA to transform the correlated predictors into a set of orthogonal (uncorrelated) components. You can then use these components as predictors in your regression model.

4. Ridge or Lasso Regression: These regularization techniques can help mitigate multicollinearity by penalizing the absolute size of the regression coefficients. Ridge regression, in particular, can be useful in reducing the impact of correlated predictors.

## 6. Describe a random forest. How are they better than decision trees?

 A decision tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm that represents a hierarchical, tree-like structure for making decisions and predictions. Each internal node of the tree represents a decision based on a feature attribute, leading to branches representing the possible outcomes of the decision. These branches ultimately lead to leaf nodes that provide the final prediction or decision. Decision trees are interpretable and useful for visualizing decision-making processes, but they can be prone to overfitting. Ensemble methods like Random Forests address this by combining multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and generalization.

 A Random Forest is an ensemble learning method used in machine learning for both classification and regression tasks. It is an extension of decision trees and is designed to overcome some of the limitations of individual decision trees while improving predictive accuracy and generalization. 


Reduced Overfitting: Random Forests mitigate overfitting by *averaging* predictions from multiple trees, resulting in better generalization to new data.

Improved Accuracy: Random Forests typically provide more accurate predictions due to the aggregation of multiple trees that capture complex patterns in the data.

Robustness to Outliers: They are more robust to outliers and noisy data because they combine the outputs of multiple trees, which can handle unusual data points effectively.

Feature Importance: Random Forests offer a measure of feature importance, aiding in feature selection and understanding the data.

Parallelization: Building individual trees in a Random Forest can be done in parallel, making it efficient for large datasets.

Handling High-Dimensional Data: They effectively handle datasets with many features without requiring extensive feature selection, as they automatically select subsets of features for each tree.

Out-of-Bag (OOB) Error Estimation: Random Forests utilize OOB samples for estimating generalization error without the need for a separate validation se


## 7. In the credit project I did, there are many rows with missing values when we are trying to predict the likelihood of a given transaction behind a fraud. How do I deal with it?

1 Data Understanding:

Start by understanding the nature and patterns of missing data. Identify which variables have missing values and the reasons behind the missingness. For example, are they missing completely at random, or is there a systematic reason for the missing values?

2 Data Imputation:

Choose an appropriate imputation strategy based on the type of missing data:
For numerical features, you can impute missing values with the mean, median, or a statistically estimated value based on other related features.
For categorical features, you can impute missing values with the mode (most frequent category) or use a separate category to represent missing values.
Consider more advanced imputation methods like regression imputation or k-nearest neighbors imputation for complex relationships.

3 Feature Engineering:

Create new features that encode information about missingness. For example, you can add binary flags indicating whether a value was missing or not, which can sometimes be informative for the model.

4 Model-Based Imputation:

Utilize predictive models (e.g., decision trees, random forests) to predict missing values based on other available features. This approach can capture complex relationships in the data.

5 Multiple Imputations:

Consider multiple imputations to account for uncertainty in imputed values. Techniques like Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) generate multiple datasets with imputed values and average the results from multiple models.

6 Domain Knowledge:

Leverage domain knowledge to determine appropriate imputation strategies. Sometimes, domain experts can provide insights into the most reasonable way to fill missing data.

7 Data Collection:

If feasible, try to collect additional data or features that might help predict missing values more accurately. This can improve imputation quality.

8 Evaluate Impact:

Assess the impact of different imputation methods on your model's performance. Use techniques like cross-validation to compare the results of different strategies and choose the one that works best for your specific problem.


## 8. Say you are running a logistic regression and the results look weird. How do you improve or what other models would you look into?

Feature Selection and Engineering:

Carefully select relevant features and remove irrelevant ones to simplify the model.
Consider feature engineering to create new informative variables.

Regularization:

Apply L1 (Lasso) or L2 (Ridge) regularization to control overfitting and improve generalization.

Or... add additional features:

Logistic Regression is generally high bias, so adding more features should be helpful? 

Normalizing:

No feature should dominate the model, should be normalized.

Model Evaluation:

Use appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and cross-validation to assess model performance.
Can also do k-fold cross validation along with hyperparametic tuning.
Consider ROC AUC and confusion matrices for a more comprehensive evaluation.

Consider Alternative Models:

If logistic regression results remain unsatisfactory, explore alternative models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Support Vector Machines (SVM) to capture more complex relationships in the data.



## 9. You are running a classic linear regression but accidentally duplicated every data point. What are the implication?

Impact on Coefficients: The regression coefficients (slope and intercept) will not change because they are determined based on the relative differences between data points. Duplicating data points does not alter the relationships between the independent and dependent variables.

Standard Errors and P-values: The standard errors of the coefficients may decrease because you have effectively increased the sample size. As a result, p-values associated with the coefficients may become smaller, potentially leading to the incorrect conclusion that some predictors are statistically significant when they are not.

R-squared and F-statistic: The R-squared value, which measures the proportion of variance explained by the model, will not change because it is based on the overall fit of the model to the data, not the specific data points. Similarly, the F-statistic for the overall significance of the model may not change significantly.

Confidence Intervals: The confidence intervals for the regression coefficients may become narrower due to the increased sample size. However, this does not improve the validity of the regression results if the data is duplicated.

Residuals and Model Fit: The residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values) will not be affected by duplicating data points. The model's fit to the data will remain the same.

Interpretation and Generalization: The key issue with duplicating data points is that it does not improve the quality of the analysis or the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. In fact, it can introduce bias and inaccuracies in the analysis.



## 10. Compare and contrast Random forest and Gradient Boost


Random Forest and Gradient Boosting are both ensemble learning techniques used in machine learning for both classification and regression tasks. However, they have some significant differences in their underlying algorithms and how they build ensembles. 

Random Forest and Gradient Boosting are both ensemble learning techniques, but they differ in several key aspects. Random Forest builds multiple decision trees independently with bootstrapped data and random feature selection, reducing variance and producing robust models. In contrast, Gradient Boosting constructs decision trees sequentially, correcting errors from previous trees using weighted data, achieving high predictive performance but potentially requiring more careful hyperparameter tuning. Random Forest is parallelizable, making it suitable for distributed computing, while Gradient Boosting is typically sequential. Random Forest is known for its simplicity and feature importance scores, whereas Gradient Boosting excels in predictive accuracy but can be less interpretable. The choice between them depends on specific problem characteristics and priorities.


Random Forest:

Base Learners:

Random Forest is an ensemble of decision trees. It builds multiple decision trees independently and combines their predictions.

Training Process:

Each decision tree in a Random Forest is built using a random subset of the training data (bootstrapping).
Feature selection is randomized, typically considering a random subset of features at each split.

Parallelization:

Random Forest can be parallelized because each decision tree can be built independently.

Bias-Variance Trade-off:

Random Forest reduces variance (overfitting) compared to individual decision trees by averaging predictions across multiple trees.

Handling Overfitting:

It typically uses no or minimal pruning on individual trees, as the ensemble averaging mitigates overfitting.

Interpretability:

Random Forest provides feature importance scores, but interpreting individual trees in the ensemble can be challenging.



Gradient Boosting:

Base Learners:

Gradient Boosting builds an ensemble of decision trees sequentially. Each tree corrects the errors of the previous one.

Training Process:

Each decision tree is built using a weighted version of the training data. Data points that were misclassified or had higher residuals in the previous tree are given more weight in the subsequent tree.

Parallelization:

Gradient Boosting is typically sequential because each tree relies on the previous one's predictions.

Bias-Variance Trade-off:

Gradient Boosting reduces both bias (underfitting) and variance (overfitting) by gradually improving the model with each new tree.

Handling Overfitting:

It often uses shallow trees (few nodes) and a small learning rate to prevent overfitting.

Interpretability:

Gradient Boosting can be less interpretable due to the sequential nature of building trees. However, it offers feature importance scores and can sometimes be visualized to understand the model's behavior.

## 11. Say we are running a binary classification model, and rejected applicants must be supplied with a reason. How would you supply the reasons?

Feature Importance Analysis:

Perform feature importance analysis on your binary classification model to identify which features or factors had the most influence on the rejection decision.
Features with higher importance values are more likely to be relevant in explaining the decision.

Threshold Analysis:

Examine the threshold used for classifying applicants as "rejected." Adjust the threshold to be more lenient or strict based on your business requirements.
By changing the threshold, you can provide reasons to applicants whose scores fall near the decision boundary.

Top N Influential Features:

Select the top N most influential features that contributed to the rejection decision, where N is a manageable number.
Provide applicants with information about their performance or attributes in these key areas.

Reason Codes:

Assign reason codes or labels to each rejected applicant based on the specific factors that contributed to their rejection.
These reason codes can be predefined categories (e.g., low credit score, insufficient income) or descriptive labels.

After finding our the reason, plot them indivdually against the y, to plot a RESPONSE CURVE!


## 12. Say you are given a very large corpus of words. How do you identify synonyms?

Leverage Lexical Resources:

Utilize established lexical resources like WordNet, Roget's Thesaurus, or similar databases that provide structured information about synonyms and related words. These resources categorize words into synsets (sets of synonyms) and can be queried programmatically.

Word Embeddings and Cosine Similarity:

Train or use pre-trained word embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText on your corpus. Word embeddings capture semantic relationships between words, making it possible to find synonyms based on vector similarity. Words with similar embeddings are likely to be synonyms. Compute cosine similarity between word vectors in your embeddings. Words with high cosine similarity are more likely to be synonyms. You can use libraries like scikit-learn or gensim in Python for this purpose.

Word Frequency and Context Analysis:

Analyze word frequency patterns in your corpus. Words that frequently co-occur in similar contexts may be synonyms. Techniques like pointwise mutual information (PMI) or term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) can help identify related words. Use contextual analysis and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify synonyms based on the context in which words are used. For example, word sense disambiguation algorithms can help distinguish between different meanings of a word.

Clustering and Machine Learning:

Apply clustering algorithms, such as k-means or hierarchical clustering, to group words with similar context or embeddings. Words in the same cluster may be synonyms or have related meanings. Train machine learning models like word2vec or BERT on your corpus and use them to predict synonyms or word relationships. These models can capture complex semantic information.

Validation and Customization:

Validate synonym identification results and consider building custom synonym databases for domain-specific vocabularies when needed.

## 13. Bias Variance Tradeoff?

Bias: Bias represents the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem, which may be complex, by a simplified model. High bias can lead to underfitting, where the model is too simplistic and fails to capture important relationships in the data. Models with high bias have poor training and test performance.

Variance: Variance represents the error introduced by the model's sensitivity to small fluctuations or noise in the training data. High variance can lead to overfitting, where the model captures noise in the training data and does not generalize well to new data. Models with high variance perform well on the training data but poorly on the test data.

The bias-variance trade-off is a balance between these two sources of error. Ideally, you want a model that has enough complexity to capture the underlying patterns in the data (low bias) but not too much complexity that it fits the noise (low variance). Achieving this balance typically involves tuning model hyperparameters, selecting appropriate algorithms, and adjusting the model's complexity.

Error = Bias² + Variance + Irreducible Error

Error: The overall error of the model on the test data.
Bias²: The squared bias term, representing how much the model's predictions systematically deviate from the true values.
Variance: The variance term, representing how much the model's predictions vary when trained on different subsets of the data.
Irreducible Error: The error that cannot be reduced, as it is inherent to the problem's complexity and noise in the data.


## 14. Define cross validation and give examples

Cross-validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models. It divides the dataset into training and testing sets multiple times to provide an accurate estimate of a model's performance on new, unseen data.


Examples of Cross-Validation Techniques:

K-Fold Cross-Validation:

The dataset is divided into K equal-sized folds (partitions).
The model is trained and tested K times, with each fold serving as the test set once and the remaining folds as the training set.
Final performance metrics are usually averaged across the K iterations.


Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation:

Similar to K-Fold Cross-Validation but ensures that each fold maintains the same class distribution as the entire dataset, which is crucial for imbalanced datasets.

Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV):

Each data point serves as the test set once, while the remaining data points are used for training.
LOOCV is computationally expensive for large datasets but provides a robust estimate of model performance.

Cross-validation helps prevent overfitting, provides more reliable estimates of a model's performance, and aids in model selection and hyperparameter tuning. It is a crucial step in evaluating the generalization ability of machine learning models.

## 15. How to build a lead scoring algo to predict whether a prospective company is likely to convert into enterprise customer?

Lead scoring is a method used in sales and marketing to evaluate and rank the potential of leads (prospective customers) based on their likelihood to convert into paying customers. It helps prioritize and focus sales and marketing efforts on leads that are most likely to result in successful conversions. Lead scoring is typically done by assigning a numerical score or grade to each lead based on various criteria and behaviors. Here are more specific examples of lead scoring criteria:

1 Data Collection:

Gather historical data on leads and their outcomes, including which leads converted into enterprise customers and which did not.
Collect data on various attributes of the leads and their interactions with your company, such as website visits, email responses, webinar attendance, and more.

2 Data Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, outliers, and data types.
Normalize or scale numerical features if needed.
Encode categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding.

3 Feature Engineering:

Create relevant features that may influence lead conversion. These features could include:
Lead demographics (industry, location, company size).
Lead behavior (website engagement, email open rates, response times).
Interaction history (number of touchpoints, type of touchpoints).
Historical conversion rates for leads from similar industries or demographics.

4 Data Splitting:

Split your dataset into training, validation, and test sets. A common split might be 70% training, 15% validation, and 15% test data.

5 Model Selection:

Choose an appropriate machine learning model for classification. Common choices include logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting, or neural networks.
Experiment with different algorithms to find the one that best fits your data. Logistic reg makes more sense since it's a straightforward solution with easily interpretable result.


6 Model Training:

Train the selected model using the training data.
Tune hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or randomized search.
Monitor model performance on the validation set during training.


16. How would you approach creating a music recommendation algo?

Creating a music recommendation algorithm involves leveraging user data and machine learning techniques to provide personalized music recommendations based on a user's preferences. Here's a high-level approach to building such an algorithm:

1 Data Collection:

Gather a comprehensive dataset of music tracks, including metadata (e.g., artist, genre, release date) and user interactions (e.g., listening history, user ratings, playlists). Utilize public music datasets or collaborate with music streaming platforms to obtain user data.

2 Data Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers. Create user-item interaction matrices, where rows represent users, columns represent music tracks, and values represent interactions (e.g., play counts, likes).

3 Feature Engineering:

Extract relevant features from the music metadata, such as genre, artist popularity, release date, and acoustic features (e.g., tempo, mood, key). Incorporate user-specific features, including demographics and historical user interactions.

4 User Profiling:

Create user profiles by analyzing historical interactions and preferences. Techniques like collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, or deep learning can be used to learn latent user preferences.
  
  Content-Based Filtering:

Use content-based recommendation techniques to suggest music based on track features and user preferences. For example, recommend songs with similar genres or acoustic properties to those liked by the user.

  Collaborative Filtering:

Implement collaborative filtering methods, such as user-based or item-based recommendation, to identify music tracks liked by users with similar preferences. Matrix factorization (e.g., Singular Value Decomposition or matrix factorization techniques like Matrix Factorization) can also be effective.

  Hybrid Models:

Combine content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to create hybrid recommendation models that leverage both user profiles and item features.

5 Evaluation:

Split the dataset into training and test sets to evaluate the model's performance. Common evaluation metrics include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and precision-recall metrics.
Implement A/B testing or online evaluation to assess the real-world impact of recommendations on user engagement and satisfaction.

6 Scalability:

Ensure the algorithm can handle large-scale datasets and real-time recommendation requests. Consider distributed computing and caching mechanisms to optimize recommendations.

7 Feedback Loop:

Continuously collect user feedback and interaction data to update and improve the recommendation algorithm. Implement reinforcement learning techniques to adapt to changing user preferences.

8 Deployment:

Integrate the recommendation algorithm into a music streaming platform or application to provide users with personalized music recommendations in real time.

9 User Interface:

Design a user-friendly interface that displays recommended songs and allows users to provide feedback on recommendations (likes, dislikes).

10 Privacy and Data Security:

Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations and take measures to protect user data.
Building a music recommendation algorithm is an iterative process that involves refining and fine-tuning the model based on user feedback and data insights. The goal is to provide users with a personalized music experience that keeps them engaged and satisfied.

## 17. Define what it means for a function to be convex. What is an example of a ML algo that is not convex and why? What about in the field of finance?

A function is considered convex if, for any two points within its domain, the line segment connecting these two points lies entirely above or on the graph of the function. In other words, a function f(x) is convex if, for all x1 and x2 in its domain and for all values of t in the interval [0, 1], the following inequality holds:

f(tx1 + (1 - t)x2) ≤ tf(x1) + (1 - t)f(x2)

In simple terms, a convex function forms a "bowl-like" shape where any chord connecting two points on the graph lies above the graph itself.

Examples of Convex Functions:

Linear functions: f(x) = ax + b, where a is a constant.
Quadratic functions with a positive coefficient for the squared term: f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c, where a > 0.
Exponential functions: f(x) = e^ax, where a is a constant.
Machine Learning Algorithm Example That Is Not Convex:

Neural Networks: Neural networks, especially deep neural networks, are not convex with respect to their loss functions. The loss surface is highly non-convex due to the presence of multiple local minima and saddle points. The non-convexity of neural network loss surfaces makes optimization challenging, and finding the global minimum is not guaranteed.

Finance Example of Non-Convexity:

Portfolio Optimization: In finance, portfolio optimization involves selecting a combination of assets to maximize returns while managing risk. The objective function for portfolio optimization is typically non-convex due to the presence of multiple assets with different correlations and risk-return profiles. Finding the optimal allocation that maximizes returns while minimizing risk involves dealing with a non-convex optimization problem. Various techniques, such as mean-variance optimization and heuristic algorithms, are used to address the non-convexity of this problem.
In both machine learning and finance, dealing with non-convex optimization problems requires specialized optimization techniques, global search algorithms, or heuristic methods to find satisfactory solutions in the presence of multiple local minima or complex, non-convex loss surfaces.


## 18. Explain what information gain and entopy are in context of a decision tree and give me a numerical example.

In the context of decision trees, information gain and entropy are used to determine the best attribute to split the data at each node, aiming to maximize the effectiveness of the tree in classifying or predicting outcomes. 

Entropy:
Entropy is a measure of impurity or disorder in a dataset. In the context of decision trees, it quantifies how mixed or uncertain the class labels are within a dataset. The entropy of a node (S) is calculated using the formula:
S = -p1 * log2(p1) - p2 * log2(p2) - ... - pk * log2(pk)
Where:

p1, p2, ..., pk are the proportions of different classes within the node.
k is the number of distinct classes.
Entropy ranges from 0 (pure node with one class) to 1 (maximum impurity with equal proportions of all classes). A lower entropy indicates a more homogeneous node.

Information Gain:
Information gain (IG) is a measure of how much the entropy decreases when a dataset is split based on a particular attribute. It quantifies the reduction in uncertainty or disorder. The information gain for an attribute (A) is calculated as follows:

IG(A) = S(parent) - Σ (|Si| / |S|) * S(Si)
Where:

S(parent) is the entropy of the parent node before the split.
n is the number of possible values (branches) of attribute A.
|Si| is the number of instances in the i-th branch.
S(Si) is the entropy of the i-th branch.
A higher information gain indicates that splitting the dataset based on attribute A results in a more significant reduction in entropy and, therefore, better class separation.

Let's consider a binary classification problem where we want to decide whether to play tennis (yes or no) based on weather attributes (Outlook, Temperature, Humidity, Wind).

Suppose we have the following data for 14 instances:

- 9 instances with a "Yes" label (play tennis).
- 5 instances with a "No" label (don't play tennis).

The initial entropy of the dataset is calculated as:

S(parent) = - (9/14) * log2(9/14) - (5/14) * log2(5/14) ≈ 0.94


Now, let's consider splitting the data based on the "Outlook" attribute, which has three possible values: Sunny, Overcast, Rainy. We calculate the entropy for each branch:

- For "Sunny" days (5 instances, 3 "Yes," 2 "No"):

S(Sunny) = - (3/5) * log2(3/5) - (2/5) * log2(2/5) ≈ 0.97

- For "Overcast" days (4 instances, all "Yes"):

S(Overcast) = 0 // perfectly pure

- For "Rainy" days (5 instances, 1 "Yes," 4 "No"):

S(Rainy) = - (1/5) * log2(1/5) - (4/5) * log2(4/5) ≈ 0.72


## 20. what is L1 and L2 regulatization? Whare are the differences betwee nthe two?

L1 and L2 regularization are techniques used in machine learning and statistics to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of models, particularly linear models like linear regression or logistic regression. They are also known as Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) regularization, respectively. Here's an explanation of each and the key differences between the two:

L1 Regularization (Lasso):

Penalty Term: L1 regularization adds a penalty term to the cost function of a linear model. The penalty term is the absolute sum of the model's coefficients (weights).
Objective Function: The objective function with L1 regularization can be written as:
J(w) = Loss(w) + λ * Σ|wi|
where Loss(w) represents the loss without regularization, wi are the model coefficients, and λ is the regularization hyperparameter. The term Σ|wi| encourages sparsity in the model, meaning it tends to set some coefficients to exactly zero.
Effect: L1 regularization encourages feature selection by driving some coefficients to zero. It effectively performs feature selection and simplifies the model by eliminating less important features.

L2 Regularization (Ridge):

Penalty Term: L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the cost function of a linear model. The penalty term is the sum of the squares of the model's coefficients (weights).
Objective Function: The objective function with L2 regularization can be written as:

J(w) = Loss(w) + λ * Σ(wi^2)

where Loss(w) represents the loss without regularization, wi are the model coefficients, and λ is the regularization hyperparameter. The term Σ(wi^2) discourages large coefficients and tends to distribute the impact of features more evenly.
Effect: L2 regularization does not drive coefficients to exactly zero but rather reduces the magnitude of all coefficients. It helps prevent overfitting by imposing a "shrinkage" effect on coefficients and can improve the stability of the model.

KEY DIFFERENCES:

Effect on Coefficients:

L1 regularization encourages sparsity by driving some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.
L2 regularization reduces the magnitude of all coefficients but does not force them to be exactly zero.

Feature Selection:

L1 regularization is often used when feature selection is desired or when there is a suspicion that only a subset of features is relevant.
L2 regularization primarily focuses on improving model stability and preventing overfitting but does not perform explicit feature selection.

Robustness to Multicollinearity:

L2 regularization is more robust to multicollinearity (high correlation between features) compared to L1 regularization.
L1 regularization may arbitrarily select one feature among a group of highly correlated features, making it less robust in such cases.

Sensitivity to Hyperparameter λ:

L1 regularization tends to set some coefficients to exactly zero for sufficiently large values of λ.
L2 regularization primarily controls the magnitude of coefficients but rarely forces them to be exactly zero.
In practice, a combination of L1 and L2 regularization, known as Elastic Net regularization, is often used to leverage the benefits of both techniques. The choice between L1 and L2 regularization depends on the specific problem, the need for feature selection, and the desired model characteristics.


##  20. Describe Gradient Descent and the motivations behding Stochastic Gradient Descent.

Gradient Descent (GD) is a fundamental optimization algorithm used in machine learning and numerical optimization to minimize a cost function. The primary motivation behind Gradient Descent is to find the minimum of a cost function, which typically represents the difference between the predicted and actual values (i.e., the error) in a machine learning model. Here's how GD works:

Initialization: GD starts with an initial guess for the model's parameters (e.g., weights and biases).

Iterative Updates: In each iteration, GD calculates the gradient of the cost function with respect to the model parameters. The gradient represents the direction and magnitude of the steepest ascent (increase) in the cost function.

Parameter Update: GD adjusts the model's parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient to move closer to the minimum of the cost function. The update rule typically follows:

θ_new = θ_old - learning_rate * gradient


Here, θ_old represents the current parameter values, learning_rate is a hyperparameter that controls the step size, and gradient is the calculated gradient.

Repeat: Steps 2 and 3 are repeated iteratively until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum number of iterations or achieving a small gradient magnitude.

-SGD differs from traditional gradient descent by using a random subset (mini-batch) of the training data in each iteration to estimate the gradient. This stochastic nature introduces noise, which can lead to faster convergence and help escape local minima. SGD is particularly well-suited for large datasets and complex models, making it a popular choice for training deep neural networks. However, its performance may require tuning of hyperparameters like the learning rate, and it is more sensitive to data preprocessing and initialization, but it remains a key optimization method in modern machine learning.


##  21. If we have a classifier that produces a score between 0 and 1 for the probability of a loan application as fraud. For each application's score we take the square root of that score. How would the ROC curve change? If it doesn't change, what kinds of function would change the curve?

The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is primarily used to evaluate the performance of binary classifiers across different discrimination thresholds. The square root transformation of the classifier's scores, ranging from 0 to 1, will affect the ROC curve by changing the threshold at which you classify instances as positive or negative, but it won't fundamentally change the curve's shape.

Here's how it works:

Original ROC Curve: In the original ROC curve, you vary the classification threshold from 0 to 1 to calculate true positive rates (TPR) and false positive rates (FPR) at different threshold levels. The curve illustrates the trade-off between TPR and FPR as you change the threshold.

Transformed Scores: When you take the square root of the classifier's scores, you effectively create a new set of transformed scores ranging from 0 to 1, but these transformed scores are still monotonically increasing with respect to the original scores. In other words, the relative ordering of instances based on their fraud probability remains the same.

Effect on ROC Curve: The ROC curve will still depict the trade-off between TPR and FPR, but the specific values of TPR and FPR at different thresholds will change due to the transformation. The overall shape of the ROC curve, with its upward slope, will remain the same.

To fundamentally change the shape of the ROC curve, you would need to introduce a non-monotonic transformation or change the underlying classification algorithm significantly. Common ways to affect the ROC curve include altering the classifier's parameters, changing the feature set, or modifying the classification algorithm itself. These changes can lead to shifts in the trade-off between TPR and FPR and potentially result in different ROC curves.


##  22. Say X is a univariate gaussian random variable. what is the entropy of X

The entropy of a continuous random variable, such as a univariate Gaussian random variable X, can be calculated using the probability density function (PDF) of the variable. For a Gaussian random variable with mean μ and standard deviation σ, the PDF is given by:

f(x) = (1 / (σ√(2π))) * exp(-(x - μ)^2 / (2σ^2))

H(X) = -∫[f(x) * log(f(x))] dx

You can evaulate it with bounds infinity to -infinity and get:

H(X) = (1/2) + log σ SQRT(2pi)


## 23. How would you build a model to calculate a customer's propensity to buy an item?

High level overview:

Building a model to calculate a customer's propensity to buy a particular item involves several steps in the data science and machine learning process. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

Certainly, let's create a more specific example for building a model to calculate a customer's propensity to buy a particular item, such as a high-end smartphone:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather data about your customers, including demographics (age, gender, location), past purchase history (items bought, purchase dates, purchase amounts), website behavior (pages visited, time spent), and any other relevant information.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean the data, handle missing values, and format inconsistencies.
   - Engineer features like the customer's average spending, frequency of visits, and recency of the last purchase.

3. **Feature Selection:**
   - Select features that are likely to influence a customer's propensity to buy a high-end smartphone. These might include age, income, past purchases of similar products, and recent website visits to smartphone product pages.

4. **Data Splitting:**
   - Split your dataset into training, validation, and test sets. For example, use 70% of the data for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing.

5. **Model Selection:**
   - Choose an appropriate model. For this binary classification problem (buy or not buy), you might start with logistic regression, a decision tree, or a random forest.

6. **Model Training:**
   - Train the selected model on the training data using the chosen features. The model will learn to predict whether a customer is likely to buy a high-end smartphone.

7. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Optimize the model's hyperparameters using the validation set. For instance, you can tune the regularization strength in logistic regression or the maximum depth in decision trees.

8. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the test set. Calculate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. You might want to achieve a high precision to minimize false positives (e.g., offering a smartphone to customers unlikely to buy).

9. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the model in your e-commerce platform. It can provide real-time predictions as customers interact with your website or make purchase decisions.

10. **Monitoring and Maintenance:**
    - Continuously monitor the model's performance in production. Reassess and retrain the model as needed, especially when introducing new smartphone models or changes to your website.

11. **Interpretability and Explainability:**
    - Explain the model's predictions to stakeholders by highlighting important features that influence a customer's propensity to buy a smartphone. This can help marketing teams tailor their strategies.

12. **Feedback Loop:**
    - Collect feedback from customers and sales data. Use this feedback to improve the model and refine your marketing efforts, customer targeting, and product recommendations.

Building a customer propensity model is an iterative process that requires a combination of domain knowledge, data engineering, and machine learning expertise to create a model that accurately predicts customer behavior.

** to ADD:

Logistic Regression:

Pros:

Simple and interpretable. Coefficients can indicate the impact of each feature on the propensity to buy.
Computationally efficient and fast to train on large datasets.
Works well when there's a linear or close-to-linear relationship between features and the target.
Cons:

Assumes a linear relationship, which may not capture complex interactions between features.
May not perform as well as more complex models when there are nonlinear relationships in the data.
Sensitive to outliers.


Decision Trees:

Pros:

Highly interpretable, as you can visualize the tree structure and understand the decision-making process.
Can capture complex, nonlinear relationships between features.
Handles both numerical and categorical data without the need for extensive preprocessing.
Cons:

Prone to overfitting, especially on small datasets or deep trees. Pruning is often required.
May create biased trees if certain classes are dominant in the data, requiring class balancing techniques.
Trees can be unstable, meaning small changes in data can lead to different tree structures.


Random Forests (Ensemble of Decision Trees):

Pros:

Combines the strengths of decision trees with improved generalization and reduced overfitting.
Handles high-dimensional data and can deal with feature importance estimation.
Provides robust predictions by aggregating multiple decision trees.
Cons:

Less interpretable than a single decision tree due to the ensemble nature.
Can be computationally expensive, especially with a large number of trees.
May still be prone to bias if the dataset is imbalanced, although it's less affected than individual trees.


## 24. Compare and contrast GNB and Logistic Regression, what are pros and cons

**Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB)** and **Logistic Regression** are two commonly used classification algorithms in machine learning, each with its own set of strengths and weaknesses. Here's a comparison of the two, including their pros and cons:

**Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB):**
GNB is a probabilistic classification algorithm.
It's based on Bayes' theorem and makes an independence assumption between features (hence "naive").
Suitable for both binary and multiclass classification tasks.
Particularly effective for text classification and spam email detection.
Provides class probabilities as output.

- **Pros:**
  1. **Simple and Fast:** GNB is a simple and computationally efficient algorithm, making it suitable for large datasets.
  2. **Low Data Requirement:** It can work well with a small amount of training data.
  3. **Handles High-Dimensional Data:** GNB performs surprisingly well in high-dimensional spaces, such as text classification tasks.
  4. **Probabilistic Output:** GNB provides class probabilities, which can be useful for ranking predictions and understanding uncertainty.
  5. **Handles Categorical Data:** It can naturally handle categorical features without the need for one-hot encoding.

- **Cons:**
  1. **Naive Assumption:** GNB assumes that features are conditionally independent, which may not hold in real-world data. This simplification can lead to suboptimal results.
  2. **Limited Expressiveness:** GNB may not capture complex relationships between features as effectively as other algorithms.
  3. **Sensitive to Feature Scaling:** GNB's performance can be influenced by the scaling of continuous features.

**Logistic Regression:**

Logistic Regression is a statistical model used for binary classification tasks.
It models the relationship between the features and the probability of a binary outcome.
Provides interpretable results, with coefficients indicating feature importance.
Can be extended to multiclass classification using techniques like one-vs-all.
Works well when relationships between features are not assumed to be independent.

- **Pros:**
  1. **Interpretability:** Logistic Regression provides interpretable results, as the coefficients can be directly linked to the impact of features on the prediction.
  2. **No Assumption of Independence:** Unlike GNB, Logistic Regression does not assume feature independence, making it more suitable for correlated data.
  3. **Flexible Thresholding:** You can easily adjust the decision threshold to control precision and recall trade-offs.
  4. **Well-Suited for Binary Classification:** Logistic Regression is a natural choice for binary classification problems.

- **Cons:**
  1. **Linear Decision Boundary:** Logistic Regression models assume a linear decision boundary, which may limit their ability to capture complex, nonlinear relationships in the data.
  2. **Susceptible to Outliers:** Logistic Regression can be sensitive to outliers, as it minimizes the logistic loss function.
  3. **Limited for Multiclass Problems:** While it can be extended to multiclass classification, Logistic Regression may not perform as well as other methods like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting for such tasks.

In summary, GNB is a simple and fast algorithm suitable for cases where the independence assumption holds reasonably well, especially for text classification. Logistic Regression is a versatile algorithm with strong interpretability, making it a good choice for binary classification problems when the relationships between features are more complex. The choice between the two depends on the nature of the data and the trade-offs between interpretability, performance, and modeling assumptions.



## 25. What loss function is used in k-means clustering given K clusters and n sample points? What about in batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent

- recap, this is k-means clustering. Not k-cross validation. K-means clustering is a form of unsupervised learning, uses elbow method (see Q3), etc.

But -- this is the answer to the LOSS FUNCTIONS: 

In K-means clustering, the primary objective is to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares, which is also known as the **inertia** or **distortion**. The loss function used in K-means clustering is the sum of the squared Euclidean distances between each data point and the centroid of the cluster it belongs to. Given K clusters and n sample points, the loss function for K-means clustering can be written as:

```
Loss = Σ (distance(data_point_i, centroid_cluster_i))^2
```

Where:
- `data_point_i` is a data point.
- `centroid_cluster_i` is the centroid of the cluster to which `data_point_i` belongs.
- The summation Σ is taken over all data points.

The objective in K-means clustering is to find cluster assignments and centroids that minimize this loss function.

Now, when it comes to optimization algorithms like batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), they are typically not used directly in traditional K-means clustering because K-means does not involve optimizing a differentiable loss function. K-means uses an iterative approach that directly updates cluster assignments and centroids based on distance computations. It does not involve gradient-based optimization.

Instead, K-means employs an algorithm called the **Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm** or its variant called the **Lloyd's algorithm** to iteratively update cluster assignments and centroids. These algorithms do not rely on gradient descent or loss functions in the same way that supervised learning algorithms do.

In summary, K-means clustering uses the inertia or within-cluster sum of squares as a loss function to minimize during clustering, but it does not directly employ batch gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent for optimization. Instead, it uses specialized algorithms designed for clustering tasks, such as the EM or Lloyd's algorithm.


## 26. Describe the kernel trick in SVMs and give a simple example. How do you describe what kernel to choose? In your answer define SVM, Kernels

**Support Vector Machine (SVM)** is a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. The fundamental idea behind SVM is to find a hyperplane that best separates data points into different classes while maximizing the margin between the classes. However, in some cases, data may not be linearly separable in the feature space, which is where the "kernel trick" comes into play.

**Kernels in SVM:**
In SVM, a kernel is a mathematical function that implicitly maps data points into a higher-dimensional space where they can become linearly separable. The kernel trick allows SVM to find complex decision boundaries in the original feature space without explicitly transforming the data into that higher-dimensional space. This is computationally efficient and avoids the need to calculate the transformation explicitly.

**Choosing the Right Kernel:**
Choosing the appropriate kernel for your SVM depends on the nature of your data and the problem you're trying to solve. Different kernels capture different types of relationships between data points. Here are a few common kernels and when to use them:

1. **Linear Kernel (no kernel):**
   - Use when your data is linearly separable in the original feature space.
   - It's computationally efficient and often a good starting point.

2. **Polynomial Kernel:**
   - Use when the decision boundary is polynomial.
   - Choose the degree of the polynomial (e.g., quadratic, cubic) based on the complexity of your data.

3. **Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel:**
   - Use when the decision boundary is non-linear and doesn't follow a specific polynomial pattern.
   - RBF kernel is versatile and can capture complex patterns.

4. **Sigmoid Kernel:**
   - Use when the decision boundary has a sigmoid shape.
   - It's less common compared to linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels.

**Simple Example:**
Imagine you have a binary classification problem with two classes, represented by red and blue points on a 2D plane. In the original feature space, the data is not linearly separable (i.e., no straight line can separate the classes). You decide to use the RBF kernel, which maps the data to a higher-dimensional space.

The RBF kernel's decision boundary in this higher-dimensional space takes the form of a curved surface that effectively separates the red and blue points. This complex boundary is achieved without explicitly transforming the data into the higher-dimensional space, thanks to the kernel trick.

Choosing the right kernel often involves experimentation and cross-validation to determine which kernel yields the best performance for your specific dataset and classification problem.

## 27. Say we have N observations for some variable which we model as drawn from a Gaussian distribution. What are the best guesses for the parameters of the distribution?

The likelihood function is a fundamental concept in statistics and probability theory. It represents the probability of observing a set of data points, given a particular statistical model and a set of model parameters. In simple terms, the likelihood function quantifies how well the model explains the observed data.

You can estimate the parameters of a Gaussian distribution (mean and variance) by maximizing the likelihood function or, equivalently, the log-likelihood function. Here's how you can do it:

**Likelihood Function for Gaussian Distribution:**
The likelihood function for N observations (x_1, x_2, ..., x_N) assumed to be drawn from a Gaussian distribution with unknown mean (μ) and variance (σ²) is given by:

```
L(μ, σ² | x_1, x_2, ..., x_N) = Π [1 / (σ * √(2π))] * exp[-(x_i - μ)² / (2σ²)]
```

Where:
- L(μ, σ² | x_1, x_2, ..., x_N) is the likelihood function.
- μ is the mean.
- σ² is the variance.
- x_i represents each individual observation.
- Π denotes the product over all observations.

**Log-Likelihood Function:**
Taking the natural logarithm of the likelihood function simplifies calculations, as the product becomes a sum:

```
log(L(μ, σ² | x_1, x_2, ..., x_N)) = -N/2 * log(2π) - N/2 * log(σ²) - Σ (x_i - μ)² / (2σ²)
```

Now, to estimate the parameters (μ and σ²), you can maximize this log-likelihood function with respect to μ and σ². The estimates that maximize the log-likelihood are the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) for the mean (μ) and variance (σ²).

**Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLEs):**
- The MLE for the mean (μ) is the sample mean (x̄), as it maximizes the likelihood when the derivative of the log-likelihood function with respect to μ is set to zero.
- The MLE for the variance (σ²) is the sample variance (s²), as it maximizes the likelihood when the derivative of the log-likelihood function with respect to σ² is set to zero.

So, the best estimates for the parameters of the Gaussian distribution are:
- μ (mean) = x̄ (sample mean)
- σ² (variance) = s² (sample variance)

These MLEs maximize the likelihood of observing the given data under the assumed Gaussian distribution, and they are commonly used in practice for parameter estimation.

## 28. SUPER HARD> IDK if you NEED TO DO! Say you are using a Gaussian mixture model for anomaly detection of fraud transactions to classify incoming transactions into K classes. Describe the model setup formulaically and evaluate the posterior probabilities and log likelihood. How do we know if something is fraudulent?

A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is a probabilistic model used in machine learning and statistics for modeling complex data distributions. It is particularly useful for modeling data that appears to be a mixture of multiple Gaussian (normal) distributions. GMMs are widely employed for various tasks, including clustering, density estimation, and anomaly detection.


Using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for anomaly detection in fraud transactions involves modeling the data as a mixture of K Gaussian distributions, where K is the number of components or clusters. The goal is to classify incoming transactions and detect anomalies (fraudulent transactions) based on the posterior probabilities and log likelihood. Here's the setup and evaluation:

**Model Setup:**

1. **Assumptions:**
   - We assume that the data consists of N transactions, each with D-dimensional features (e.g., transaction amount, time, etc.).
   - We assume that the data is a mixture of K Gaussian distributions, where each Gaussian represents a cluster of transactions. This models the normal behavior of legitimate transactions.

2. **Parameters:**
   - The model parameters include:
     - K: The number of Gaussian components or clusters.
     - Mixing Coefficients (π): The probabilities that a data point belongs to each cluster, with Σ(π_i) = 1 for i = 1 to K.
     - Cluster Parameters (μ and Σ): The mean (μ) and covariance (Σ) for each Gaussian component.

3. **Modeling:**
   - The likelihood of observing a data point x given the Gaussian Mixture Model is:
     ```
     P(x | θ) = Σ [π_i * N(x | μ_i, Σ_i)] for i = 1 to K
     ```
     where N(x | μ_i, Σ_i) is the probability density function (PDF) of a multivariate Gaussian distribution with mean μ_i and covariance Σ_i.

**Evaluation:**

To classify an incoming transaction as fraudulent or not, you typically perform the following steps:

1. **Estimation:**
   - Use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the model parameters (π, μ, and Σ) from your training data.

2. **Inference:**
   - Given an incoming transaction x, calculate the posterior probabilities of it belonging to each cluster using Bayes' theorem:
     ```
     P(cluster_i | x) = (π_i * N(x | μ_i, Σ_i)) / Σ [π_j * N(x | μ_j, Σ_j)] for j = 1 to K
     ```
   - These posterior probabilities represent the likelihood that the transaction belongs to each cluster.

3. **Thresholding:**
   - Define a decision threshold or anomaly score. For example, you might consider transactions with a low posterior probability (below a certain threshold) as potential anomalies or fraudulent.

4. **Fraud Detection:**
   - If the posterior probability of the most likely cluster (i.e., the cluster with the highest P(cluster_i | x)) is below the threshold, classify the transaction as fraudulent. Otherwise, classify it as legitimate.

**Anomaly Detection:**
- Transactions with posterior probabilities below the threshold are considered anomalies because they have a low likelihood of belonging to any of the normal behavior clusters.
- The choice of the threshold is crucial and often involves a trade-off between false positives and false negatives. Adjusting the threshold can impact the model's performance in detecting fraud.

By setting an appropriate threshold and using the posterior probabilities obtained from the GMM, you can identify and classify incoming transactions as either legitimate or potentially fraudulent based on their deviations from the learned normal behavior.

## 29. Churning predictor?

Churning, in a business context, refers to the phenomenon where customers or subscribers stop using a company's products or services and switch to those of a competitor or simply discontinue using any such services altogether. Churning is also known as customer attrition or customer turnover.

Building a model to predict which users are likely to churn is a common approach used by companies to proactively address customer attrition. This predictive modeling process typically involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather historical data related to customer behavior and interactions. This data may include user demographics, usage patterns, transaction history, customer support interactions, and any other relevant information.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean and preprocess the data. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling or normalizing numerical features.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Create relevant features that can be used to predict churn. For example, you might calculate metrics like customer lifetime value, frequency of product usage, or customer satisfaction scores.

4. **Labeling:**
   - Define a churn event. This could be a specific action or inaction by the customer that indicates churn, such as canceling a subscription or not using the service for a certain period.

5. **Splitting Data:**
   - Divide the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the predictive model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.

6. **Model Selection:**
   - Choose an appropriate machine learning model for churn prediction. Common models include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and gradient boosting algorithms like XGBoost or LightGBM.

7. **Training and Validation:**
   - Train the model on the training dataset and validate its performance on the testing dataset. Employ techniques like cross-validation to fine-tune hyperparameters and ensure robust model performance.

8. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Select evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance. Common metrics for churn prediction include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC, and lift curves.

9. **Feature Importance Analysis:**
   - Analyze feature importance to understand which customer behaviors or characteristics are most influential in predicting churn. This can help identify areas for targeted intervention.

10. **Deployment:**
    - Once the model is trained and validated, deploy it to make real-time predictions. Integration with a customer management system or marketing automation platform allows for timely intervention.

11. **Monitoring and Feedback Loop:**
    - Continuously monitor the model's performance in production. Collect feedback on model predictions and use this feedback to improve the model over time.

12. **Intervention Strategies:**
    - Develop and implement strategies to retain at-risk customers. This might involve personalized marketing campaigns, special offers, or proactive customer support.

Predictive modeling for churn can be a valuable tool for businesses, enabling them to identify potential churners early and take proactive steps to retain customers, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and business profitability.

## 30. OLS Derivation:

In linear regression, the goal is to find the best-fitting linear relationship between a dependent variable (often denoted as "Y") and one or more independent variables (often denoted as "X"). The error term, also known as the residual, represents the difference between the observed values (Y) and the values predicted by the linear model. Assuming the error term follows a normal distribution, the objective is to minimize the sum of squared residuals (the least squares criterion) to find the optimal model parameters.

Here's the mathematical representation of this minimization process:

**1. Model Representation:**
In linear regression, the model can be expressed as:

```
Y = β0 + β1*X1 + β2*X2 + ... + βn*Xn + ε
```

- Y: Dependent variable (the observed values).
- β0, β1, β2, ..., βn: Model coefficients to be estimated.
- X1, X2, ..., Xn: Independent variables (features).
- ε (epsilon): Error term representing the deviations between observed and predicted values.

**2. Objective Function:**
The objective is to minimize the sum of squared residuals, which is the sum of the squares of the errors (ε):

```
Minimize: Σ(ε²) = Σ(Y - β0 - β1*X1 - β2*X2 - ... - βn*Xn)²
```

**3. Minimization Process:**
To find the optimal model coefficients (β0, β1, β2, ..., βn) that minimize the sum of squared residuals, you typically use a method like Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). OLS finds the values of β0, β1, β2, ..., βn that minimize the objective function above.

**4. Solving for Optimal Coefficients:**
The optimal coefficients can be found by taking the derivatives of the objective function with respect to each coefficient and setting them to zero. The resulting system of equations is then solved to obtain the coefficients:

```
∂(Σ(ε²))/∂β0 = 0
∂(Σ(ε²))/∂β1 = 0
∂(Σ(ε²))/∂β2 = 0
...
∂(Σ(ε²))/∂βn = 0
```

Solving this system of equations provides the values of β0, β1, β2, ..., βn that minimize the sum of squared residuals, effectively fitting the linear model to the data.

The assumption of normally distributed errors (ε) is often made in linear regression to justify the use of the least squares method. When this assumption holds, the OLS estimates of the coefficients are also maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) under normality assumptions.

## 31. PCA Derivation in matrix form too (HARD AF)

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used in data analysis and machine learning. It aims to transform a dataset into a new coordinate system where the data's variance is maximized along the principal axes, known as principal components. PCA is also used for data compression, feature extraction, and noise reduction.

Here's a detailed description of PCA along with the formulation and derivation in matrix form:

**PCA Formulation:**

1. **Data Matrix:** Let's assume you have a dataset represented by a data matrix **X**, where each row corresponds to an observation (data point), and each column represents a feature (variable).

2. **Centering:** Start by centering the data by subtracting the mean of each feature from the respective feature values. This step ensures that the new coordinate system is centered at the origin.

   Centered Data Matrix: **X_centered** = **X** - **μ**, where **μ** is the mean vector of the original data.

3. **Covariance Matrix:** Calculate the covariance matrix **C** of the centered data:

   **C** = (1/N) * **X_centered^T** * **X_centered**, where N is the number of data points.

4. **Eigenvalue Decomposition:** Perform an eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix **C**:

   **C** = **V** * **Λ** * **V^T**, where:
   - **V** is a matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of **C** (principal components).
   - **Λ** is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of **C**.

5. **Selecting Principal Components:** Sort the eigenvalues in descending order. The eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues represent the principal components that capture the most variance in the data.

**Derivation in Matrix Form:**

1. **Objective Function:** PCA aims to maximize the variance of the data projected onto a lower-dimensional space defined by the principal components. The k-dimensional projection is given by:

   **Y_k** = **X_centered** * **W_k**,

   where **W_k** is a matrix containing the first k principal components as its columns.

2. **Variance Maximization:** The objective is to maximize the variance of the projected data **Y_k**. This can be expressed as:

   Maximize: Var(**Y_k**) = Var(**X_centered** * **W_k**)

3. **Constrained Maximization:** Subject to the constraint that **W_k** is orthonormal (i.e., the columns of **W_k** are orthogonal unit vectors):

   **W_k^T** * **W_k** = **I_k**, where **I_k** is the k-dimensional identity matrix.

4. **Lagrange Multiplier Approach:** To solve the constrained maximization problem, introduce a Lagrange multiplier λ and formulate the Lagrangian as follows:

   L(**W_k**, λ) = Var(**X_centered** * **W_k**) - λ * (**W_k^T** * **W_k** - **I_k**)

5. **Partial Derivatives:** Take the partial derivatives of L with respect to **W_k** and λ and set them equal to zero to find the critical points:

   - ∂L/∂**W_k** = 0
   - ∂L/∂λ = 0

6. **Solve for Eigenvectors:** Solving these equations leads to the solution where the columns of **W_k** are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix **C**.

7. **Eigenvalue Interpretation:** The eigenvalues of **C** represent the variance captured by each principal component. The k principal components corresponding to the k largest eigenvalues capture the maximum variance in the data.

In summary, PCA seeks to maximize the variance of data projections while ensuring that the projection vectors (principal components) are orthonormal. This optimization problem is solved using Lagrange multipliers, leading to the eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix and the selection of principal components that capture the most variance.


## 32. Logistic Regression formulation + log-likelihood

**Logistic Regression** is a statistical model used for binary classification. It models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class. The logistic regression model is formulated as follows:

**Model Formulation:**

1. **Binary Classification:** In logistic regression, we typically have a binary response variable (also called the dependent variable) denoted as Y, which takes values 0 or 1, representing two classes.

2. **Linear Combination:** The linear regression model starts with a linear combination of the predictor variables (independent variables) denoted as X_1, X_2, ..., X_p, with corresponding coefficients β_1, β_2, ..., β_p:

   ```
   z = β_0 + β_1 * X_1 + β_2 * X_2 + ... + β_p * X_p
   ```

   Here, z is the linear combination.

3. **Logistic Transformation:** The linear combination z is transformed using the logistic function (also called the sigmoid function) to produce the estimated probability of the positive class (class 1):

   ```
   P(Y = 1 | X) = 1 / (1 + exp(-z))
   ```

   Here, exp() represents the exponential function.

4. **Log-Odds Transformation:** The log-odds (logit) transformation of the probability is often used to make the relationship linear with respect to the predictor variables:

   ```
   log(P(Y = 1 | X) / (1 - P(Y = 1 | X))) = z
   ```

   This equation represents the logistic regression model. The left-hand side is the log-odds of the probability that Y is equal to 1 given the predictor variables X.

**Maximizing Log-Likelihood:**

The logistic regression model is trained by estimating the model parameters (coefficients β_0, β_1, β_2, ..., β_p) that maximize the log-likelihood of the observed data. Here's how this is done:

1. **Likelihood Function:** The likelihood function represents the probability of observing the given binary outcomes (0s and 1s) given the model parameters. It can be expressed as:

   ```
   L(β_0, β_1, β_2, ..., β_p) = Π [P(Y_i = 1 | X_i)^Y_i * (1 - P(Y_i = 1 | X_i))^(1 - Y_i)]
   ```

   Here, the product Π is taken over all observations (i = 1 to N), and Y_i represents the observed class labels (0 or 1) for each observation X_i.

2. **Log-Likelihood:** To simplify calculations, we often work with the log-likelihood, which is the natural logarithm of the likelihood:

   ```
   LL(β_0, β_1, β_2, ..., β_p) = Σ [Y_i * log(P(Y_i = 1 | X_i)) + (1 - Y_i) * log(1 - P(Y_i = 1 | X_i))]
   ```

   Here, the sum Σ is taken over all observations (i = 1 to N).

3. **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE):** The goal is to find the values of β_0, β_1, β_2, ..., β_p that maximize the log-likelihood function. This is typically done using optimization techniques, such as gradient descent or Newton-Raphson.

4. **Regularization (Optional):** In practice, regularization techniques like L1 (Lasso) or L2 (Ridge) regularization may be applied to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization performance. These methods introduce penalty terms into the likelihood function.

The logistic regression model parameters (coefficients) that maximize the log-likelihood are the estimated values that best describe the relationship between the predictor variables and the probability of the positive class. The model is then used to make predictions by applying the logistic transformation to new data points.
