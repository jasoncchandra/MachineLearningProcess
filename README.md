# Machine Learning Process

This is a place for me to understand and learning the whole machine learning process.

I have attached [Concepts](ML Concepts.mdx)for me to read all of the important concepts.

I have also attached [Sample Interview Questions](MLInterviewQuestions.mdx) for FAQs in interviews.

## Machine Learning Overview
1.  **Problem Definition:**
    
    -   Clearly define the problem you aim to solve. Understand the business context, objectives, and desired outcomes.
    -   Identify whether the problem requires supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning.
2.  **Data Collection:**
    
    -   Gather relevant data from various sources. This could involve databases, APIs, web scraping, or manual collection.
    -   Ensure data quality, accuracy, and consistency.
3.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    
    -   Cleanse the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
    -   Transform categorical variables into numerical representations.
    -   Normalize or standardize numerical features.
4.  **Feature Engineering:**
    
    -   Select relevant features that contribute to the model's predictive power.
    -   Create new features that capture important patterns or relationships.
    -   Perform dimensionality reduction if necessary.
5.  **Data Splitting:**
    
    -   Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test subsets.
    -   Ensure that each subset maintains the distribution of classes or outcomes.
6.  **Model Selection:**
    
    -   Choose appropriate algorithms based on the problem type and characteristics of the data.
    -   Consider factors like interpretability, performance, and computational efficiency.
7.  **Model Training:**
    
    -   Train the selected model on the training data.
    -   Adjust hyperparameters to optimize performance.
    -   Use techniques like cross-validation to avoid overfitting.
8.  **Model Evaluation:**
    
    -   Evaluate the model's performance on the validation dataset using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.).
    -   Tune the model based on evaluation results.
9.  **Model Interpretation:**
    
    -   Interpret the model's predictions to gain insights into its decision-making process.
    -   Analyze feature importances or coefficients to understand the factors influencing predictions.
10.  **Model Deployment:**

   -   Deploy the trained model to a production environment if applicable.
   -   Implement a user interface or API for model interaction.
   -   Monitor the model's performance in real-world scenarios.

12.  **Documentation and Communication:**
    
   -   Create comprehensive documentation outlining the entire process, from problem definition to deployment.
   -   Communicate results and insights to stakeholders in a clear and understandable manner.
13.  **Iterate and Improve:**
    
   -   Continuously monitor the model's performance and gather feedback.
   -   Iterate on the process to refine the model and address any issues that arise.
